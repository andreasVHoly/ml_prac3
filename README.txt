Answers to Questions:

Q1:

It took 204 iteration to reach and error of 0 on the Ubuntu lab machines.
It took 207 iteration to reach and error of 0 on my Windows laptop.

Q2:

The alogirhtm took 6 iterations with a threshold function to reach and error of 0. 
It is achieved in less iterations as we come closer to the desired values faster as we automatically round values at each step to 1 or -1.

Instructions:

1. In command window go to the directory with the files in.
2. Type 'make' to build the files.
3. Type 'make run' to run the program.
4. When prompted type either 'a' to use the activation function or 't' to use the threshold function.
5. Wait for the program to output and finish.
6. Type x to exit.
7. Type 'make clean' to clean compiled files.
